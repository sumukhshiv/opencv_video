# opencv_video

Provides individual frame information for video files. When running, change ‘rootdir’ to the present working directory of where you will be running this program. Make sure this directory contains the Python files and all videos in .mp4 format. If the program needs to be run multiple times, move the newly created output directory outside of rootdir. The function takes in an integer argument, which represents the number of frames you’d like to skip (analyze(4) would give frames 0001, 0005, 0009, .. and analyze(0) would give frames 0001, 0002, 0003,..).
